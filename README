main.cpp			Top level file. Calling functions to read netlist and print fanout information			

ReadNetlist.hpp 		
ReadNetlist.cpp 		File to read netlist from file and function calls to generate netlistgraph
				* Trim input file and skip comments
				* Read and enter data to the netlist graph using "INPUT","OUTPUT" and "=" as keywords
				* NetlistGraph is passed as pointer to this function

node.hpp 			File containing node class definition.
node.cpp			Contains member functions to node class.
				* Gate respresentative class
				* Stores input and output connection info for each node as vector of node pointers.
			  	* Stores other basic information such as gate index and type
				* Has methods to check if similar gate is present in fanin/fanout

NetlistGraph.hpp 		File containing NetlistGraph (graph) classes.
NetlistGraph.cpp 		Includes member functions to NetlistGraph class.
				* Netlist graph class 
				* Stores list of nodes in the design by name. (constructed as a map)
				* Stores primary input/output and gate types in seperate vectors for easy accesibility
				* Has methods to generate the graph and printing to file.
